# --- SonarCloud Connection Details ---
# NOTE: sonar.login and sonar.host.url are typically NOT set in this file 
# when using the official GitHub Action, as they are passed via the action's 'env' block.
# We include projectKey and organization here for clarity and standard practice.

sonar.projectKey=Aanidhay_Nexus-AI-Chatbot
sonar.organization=aanidhay

# --- Project Information ---
sonar.projectName=Nexus AI Chatbot
sonar.projectVersion=1.0

# --- Source Code Location ---
# Analyze the entire repository (the .tf, .py, .Dockerfile, etc. files)
sonar.sources=.
# sonar.tests=tests  # Uncomment and create a 'tests' folder for proper unit test analysis

# --- Exclusions: Ignore noise and managed files ---
sonar.exclusions=**/venv/**,**/__pycache__/**,**/.terraform/**,**/build/**,**/dist/**,**/*.zip,**/app.py
# Explanation of exclusions:
# **/.terraform/**: Excludes the Terraform working directory and state.
# **/venv/**, **/__pycache__/**: Excludes Python virtual environment and compiled code.
# **/*.zip: Excludes your backup zip file.
# **/app.py: Excluded from **coverage** calculation below, as per your reference's logic, 
#            but included in analysis because it is still under 'sonar.sources=.'

# --- Code Coverage Settings (Python) ---
# This path should point to the report generated by your testing tool (e.g., pytest-cov).
sonar.python.coverage.reportPaths=coverage.xml

# --- Narrowing the Focus: Files to exclude from COVERAGE METRICS ONLY ---
# This is where we ensure app.py is excluded from the coverage report as requested,
# while keeping it included in the general analysis (bugs, smells).
sonar.coverage.exclusions=**/app.py
